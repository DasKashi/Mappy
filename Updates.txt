Update 19.01.2020 - Version 1.0 + 1.01

Added:

- You can now remove any category / keyword with a right-click on the category / keyword. There's also a new "-" button at the end of each category which removes the last keyword. There's also a new "-" button at the bottom of your categories which removes the last category (With all the keywords in them). 
- You can now save multiple overlays. Create a new overlay with the "New Overlay" option and hit "Save As New Overlay" at the end to create a new *.ini with your new overlay. 
- You can now load overlays. Click "Load Overlay" and select one of your *.ini files which you'd like to use.

Bugfix: 

- Added the need to execute the script as an Admin because files might not get created otherwise
- Fixed a bug where choosing no hotkey while changing the hotkey would result in a non-crash error message
