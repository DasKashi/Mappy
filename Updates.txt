Update 13.01.2020 - Version 0.7.2

Added:
- You can add as many categories as you like with as many keywords as you like! But keep the visual cluster in mind.

Improved:
- Clicking on a keyword now checks if Path of Exile is open and only sends the keyword if it is. Won't do anything otherwise.
- Saving your categories won't highlight the overlay-window anymore to prevent confusion. Same with adding keywords.

Bugfix:
- Fixed a bug where not all keywords were displayed under certain circumstances. 

Update 12.01.2020 - Version 0.7.0 + 0.7.1

Added:
- Customizable Hotkey => You can now change the hotkey to show / hide the overlay. Press the new button "Change Toggle-Key" -> press any key (or key-combination) and hit "Save new hotkey". You can now toggle the overlay via your new hotkey
Improved: 
- Edit-fields which have no value will now be grayed out to reduce confusion
Bugfix:
- Fixed a bug which would result in ERROR-buttons when canceling the create-process

Update 11.01.2020 - Version 0.6

Added:
- Auto-updating => The script will now check if a newer version is available online and ask the user if he wants to download it
